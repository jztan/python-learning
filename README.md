# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome! This repository is a fun project where I teach my 10-year-old son Python programming. We’ll start from the basics and work our way up to creating exciting projects together.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Learn Python Basics**: Understand variables, loops, conditions, and functions.
- **Explore Turtle Graphics**: Create drawings and animations with Python's Turtle library.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what we learn to build mini-games and interactive programs.

## 📚 Lessons Overview

### 1. Simple Calculator
- Install Python and set up the environment.
- Learn basic syntax: printing, variables, data types.
- Perform simple calculations.

### 2. Guess the Number Game
- Use `if-else` conditions.
- Practice loops (`while` and `for`).
- Get input from users.

### 3. Text-Based Adventure Game
- Create functions to organize code.
- Use built-in Python modules.
- Get introduced to Turtle graphics.

### 4. Shoot the Apple
- Introduction to GUI concepts.
- Learn about mouse click events.

### 5. Singapore Weather Map
- Read data from a JSON file.
- Use Pygame to display a map and draw on it.
- Fetch data from an API and update your application dynamically.

## 🧐 Tools and Resources

- **Python 3**: Our main programming language.
- **VS Code or IDLE**: Recommended editors for writing and testing code.

## 💡 Learning Tips

- **Experiment**: Play with the code to see different outcomes.
- **Ask Questions**: If something isn’t clear, don’t hesitate to ask—problem-solving is key.
- **Take Breaks**: Stepping away helps when things get tough.
